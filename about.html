					<p><span class="idifoy">I Did It For One Year</span> was born as a personal challenge. I wanted to test myself and find out whether my will power is strong enough or not in order to achieve any goal. With that on mind, on april 19th, 2013, I devised a strategy to do a specific activity for 365 days in a row, with no stops, and I set about running. I did it with rain, snow, pain, heat, anger, joy, sadness, energy, overwhelm, and every type of emotion that you pass through in one whole year. I DID IT.</p>
						<br>
					<p>So I thought that I should never stop, and it turned out that my personal challenge has become my life philosophy. On may 1st, 2014, I decided to take a picture every single day, for one year. My current challenge (it began on July, 2015) is to read one book per month and record my progress into this website (made by me).</p>
