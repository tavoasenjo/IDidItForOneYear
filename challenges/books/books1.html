								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Every human skill, whether it's playing baseball or playing Bach, is created by chains of nerve fibers crrying a tiny electrical impulse. Myelin's vital role is to wrap those nerve fivers...making the signal stronger and faster by preventing the electrical impulses from leaking out.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Deep Practice) The first time we watch Brunio try the move, he fails, then stops and thinks. He does it again more slowly and fails again. He stops and thinks again. He does it slowly, breaking the move down to ist component parts...Then something clicks: he starts nailing the move.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Deep practice is built on a paradox: strugglin in certain targeted ways-operating at the edges of your ability, where you make mistakes-makes you smarter. 'We think of effortless performance as desirable, but it's really a terrible wat to learn' said Robert Bjork, chair of psychology at UCLA.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>A top Brazilian player spends thousands of hours at the game. The grat Juninho said he never kicked a full-size ball on grass until he was fourteen...Futsal compresses soccer's essential skills into a small box; it places players inside the deep practice zone, making and correcting errors<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(1)Every human movement, thought, feeling is a precisely timed electric signal traveling through a chain of neurons. (2)Myelin is the insulation that wraps these nerve fibers and increases signal strength, speed, and accuracy. (3)The more we fire a particular circuit, the more myelin optimizes that circuit<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>The more we develop a skill circuit, the less we're aware that we're using it. We're built to make skills automatic, to stash them in our unconscious mind. This process, which is called automaticity, exists for powerful evolutionary reasons.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>It's time to rewrite the maxim that practice makes perfect. The truth is, practice makes myelin, and myelin makes perfect. It operates by a few fundamental principles. 1-The firing of the circuit is paramount.2-Myelin is universal.3-Myelin wraps-it doesn't unwrap.4-Age matters.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Every expert in every field is the result of around ten thousand hours of commited practice. Ericsson called this process 'deliberate practice' and defined it as workin on technique, seeking constant critical feedback, and focusing ruthlessly on shoring up weaknesses<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Michelangelo)From ages six to ten he lived with a stonecutter, learning how to handle a hammer and chisel before he could read and write...He was a little-known artist until he produced the Pieta at age 24...'If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all.'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...although talent feels and looks predestined, in fact we have a good deal of control over what skills we develop, and we each have more potential than we might ever presume to guess. We are all born with the opportunity to become lords of our own Internet. The trick is to figure how to do that.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>The Holy Shit Effect is the feeling of seeing talent bloom in people who we thought were just like us...It's the feeling of, where did that come from?...It operates in one direction. The observer is dumbstruck, amazed, and bewildered, while the talent's owner is unsurprised, even blas√©<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Skill consist of identifying important elements and grouping them into a meaningful framework. The name the psycologists use for such organization is chunking... The gymnast repeats the movements often enough that he knows how to process those chunks as one big chunk<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...there seems to be a universal limit for how much deep practice human beings can do in a day. Ericcson's research shows that most world-class experts practice between three and five hours a day, no mater what skill they pursue.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>According to a 1995 study, a sample of Japanese eighth graders spent 44% of their class time inventing, thinking, and actively struggling with underlying concepts. The study's sample of American students spent less than 1% of their time in that state. 'The Japanese want their kids to struggle', said Stingler. <span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>The change didn't come from inside the athletes: they were responding to something outside them. The seventeen runners had received a clear signal-you can do this too-and the four-minute mark (per mile), once an insurmountable wall, was instantly recast as a stepping-stone<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Progress was determined not by any measurable aptitude, but a powerful idea the child had before even starting lessons...the long-term-commitment group outperformed the short-term-commitment group by 400%. When long-term commitment combined with high levels of practice, skills skyrocketed.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>'Those people over there are doing something terrifically worthwhile'. Each signal, in short, is about future belonging. Future belonging is a primal cue: a simple direct sifnal that activates our built-in motivational triggers, funneling our energy and attention toward a goal.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...our unconscious mind is a stingy banker of energy reserves, keeping its wealth locked in a vault. Direct pleas to open the vault often don't work; Scrooge can't be fooled that easily. But when he's hit with the right combination of primal cues, the tumblers click, the vault of energy flies open, and suddenly is Christmas<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Losing a parent at a youg age was not what gave them talent; rather, it was the primal cue-you are not safe-that, by tripping the ancient self-preserving evolutionary swith, provided energy for their efforts, so that they built their various talents over the course of years, step by step, wrap by wrap.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>As she explains how the lottery works, the kids bounce up and down nervously...Tzavaras returns to the classroom carrying a stack of winning applications...On hearing their names, the kids react as if they'd just received an electric shock...they are ignited, and it makes all the difference.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...talent hotbeds possess more than a single primal cue. They contain complex collections of signals -people, images, and ideas- that keep ignition going for the weeks, months, and years that skill-growing requires. Talent hotbeds are to primal cues what Las Vegas is to neon signs.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>True to the findings of Dweck's study, each of the hotbeds I visited used language that affirmed the value of effort and slow progress rather than innate talent or intelligence. At Spartak, for instance, they did not 'play' tennis -they preffered the verb borot'sya- 'fight' or 'struggle'.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>High motivation is not the kind of language that ignites people. What works is precisely the opposite: not reaching up but reaching down, speaking to the ground-level effort, affirming the struggle...phrases like 'Wow, you really tried hard' motivate far better than what she calls empty praise.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>A different kind of ignition occurs when there is no lightning strike and yet motivation and talent bloom anyway. This is the kind of ignition that relates more directly to our daily lives.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Every time a KIPP student imagines himself in college, a surge of energy is created. Every time a KIPP student forces himself to obey one of these persnickety rules, a circuit is fired, insulated, and strengthened. (Impulse control, after all, is a circuit like any other.) <span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Lamm conceived of a new system of bank robbery, applying military principles to what had been an artless profession. His singular insight was that robbing banks was not about guts or guns; it was about technique. Lamm assigned each man on his team a well-defined role. He organized rehearsals.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>'Don't look for the big, quick improvement. Seek the small improvement one day at a time. That's the only way it happens-and when it happens it lasts-'. 'The importance of repetition until automaticity cannot be overstated. Repetition is the key to learning' - John Wooden<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>It is not easy to love playing piano. It has lots of keys, and a child has lots of fingers, and there are an infinite number of mistakes that can be made. Yet certain teachers have the rare ability to make it desirable and fun...These teachers gave much positive reinforcement and only rarely were critical of the child.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...years of work go into myelinating a master coach's circuitry, which is a mysterious amalgam of technical knowledge, strategy, experience, and practiced instinct ready to be put to instant use to locate and understand where the students are and where they need to go.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>...drama and character are the tools master coaches use to reach the student with the truth about their performance...Theatrical honesty works best when teachers are performing their most essential myelinating role: pointing out errors.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Tom Martinez)'Kids today are hard to reach...They know how to give all the right answers, all the programmed answers. So when I see things, I say it so you can hear it. Each guy has his own button you can tap on...It takes work. It's like the violin. There's no magic to it. If you don't practice, you'll never play the tune'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
