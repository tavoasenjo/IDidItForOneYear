								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Jobs)'It made you realize you could build and understand anything. Once you build a couple of radios, you'd see a TV in the catalogue and say, 'I can build that as well', even if you didn't. I was very lucky, because when I was a kid both my dad and the Heathkits made me believe I could build anything'.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Jobs)'The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting...If I had never dropped in on that single course in college (calligraphy), the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts'.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Jobs)'Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That's had a big impact on my work...Coming back after seven months in Indian villages, I saw the craziness of the Western world as well as its capacity for rational thought. If you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is.'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Wozniak)'I typed a few keys on the keyboard and I was shocked! The letters were displayed on the screen.' It was Sunday, June 29, 1975. 'It was the first time in history anyone had typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on their own computer's screen right in front of them.'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>The Apple II would be marketed, in various models, for the next sixteen years, with close to six million sold...Nevertheless most people considered the Apple II to be Wozniak's creation. That would spur Jobs to pursue the next great advance, one that he could call his own.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Apple went public the morning of December 12, 1980. By then the bankers had priced the stock at $22 a share. It went to $29 the first day...At age twenty-five, he was now worth $256 million.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Wozniak) 'His reality distortion is when he has an illogical vision of the future, such as telling me that I could design the Breakout game in just a few days. You realize that it can't be true, but he somehow makes it true'. (Atkinson)'It allowed him to con people into believing his vision'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>The best products were 'whole widgets' that were designed end-to-end, with the software closely tailored to the hardware. This is what would distinguish the Macintosh, which had an operating system that worked only on its own hardware. In later years that approach would distinguish the iPhone, iPod and iPad.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984'. It was a sensation.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zfqw8nhUwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Andy Hertzfeld noticed that his contact at Microsoft was asking detailed questions about how the Macinthosh operating system worked...Gates bilieved that graphical interfaces were the future, and that Microsoft had just as much right as Apple did to copy what had been developed at Xerox PARC.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>As the Macintosh continued to disappoint-sales in March 1985 were only 10% of the budget forecast-Jobs holed up his office fuming or wandered the halls berating everyone else for the problems... Sculley also had a candidate to replace Jobs as manager of the Macintosh division: Jean-Lous Gass√©e<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Sep.17, 1985) This morning's papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as Chairman. I don't know the source of these reports but they're both misleading to the public and unfair to me. I stated I had decided to start a new venture and I tendered my resignation as a Chairman<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>By the time it launched, the NeXT would also include a dictionary, a thesaurus, and the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, making it one of the pioneers od the concep of searchable electronic books. He also insisted on building his own fully automated and futuristic factory...he made the same mistakes...<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Final agreement was reached in January 1986. For his $10 million investment, Jobs would own 70% of the company, with the rest of the stock distributed to Catmull, Smith...The division's most important piece of hardware was called Pixar Image Computer, and from it the new company took its name<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Had he known more, he would have focused on animation sooner and not worried about pushin the company's hardware or software. Had he know he hardware and software would never be profitable, he would not have taken over Pixar. 'Life kind of snookered me into doing that'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>..watching Woody and Buzz come to life made him realize that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry...Toy Story recouped its cost the first weekend ($30 million), and become the top-grossing film of the year, with $192 million domestically and a total of $362 million worldwide<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Apple needed a partner, one that could make a stable operating system, preferable one that was UNIX-like and had and object-oriented application layer. There was one company that could obviously supply such software-NeXT-. The announcement was made on Dec. 20, 1996, in front of 250 cheering employees at Apple<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>' I'd like to announce one of out firts new partnerships today, a very meaningful one, and that is one with Microsoft.'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxOp5mBY9IY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>

								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>In his first year back, Jobs laid off more than three thousand people, which salvaged the company's balance sheet.

Fot the full fiscal year of 1998, it would turn in a $309 million profit.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>

The skeptics were wrong. Gateway stores had been averaging 250 visitors a week. By 2004 Apple stores were averaging 5,400.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Jobs)'The older I get, the more I see how much motivations matter. The Zune was crappy because the people at Microsoft don't really love music or art the wway we do...If you don't love something, you're not going to go the extra mile, work the extra weekend, challenge the status quo as much.'<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>(Bono)'The "devil" here is a bunch of creative minds, more creative than a lot of people in rock bands. The lead singer is Steve Jobs. These men have helped design the most beautiful art object in music culture since the electric guitar. That's the iPod. The job of art is to chase ugliness away.<span class="quotes">"</span></h3></li>
								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>'My goal has always been not only to make great products, but to build great companies' Jobs later said. 'Walt Disney did that.

								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>To the horror of his friends and wife, Jobs decided not to have surgery to temove the tumor, which was the only accepted medical approach.

								<li class="quote_box"><h3><span class="quotes">"</span>Even when he was barely conscious, his strong personality came through. At one point the pulmonologist tried to put a mask over his face wehn he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and mumbled that he hated the design and refused to wear it.
